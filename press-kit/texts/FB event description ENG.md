# Facebook Event Description

Coding Gym is an international programming lab format open to any language and developed for continuous improvement. Coding Gym's manifesto follows:

"We help others practice programming, software development and communication skills by making coding laboratories open to any programming language where cooperation is valued over competition, doing and sharing are valued over teaching, and where competing solutions come with discussing and understanding tradeoffs."

HOW IT WORKS

Attendees - "gymmers" - work in pair on 3 self-contained challenges, using any programming language they agree upon. Everything is done on a web browser.

After each challenge, the Coding Gym "trainer" facilitates a <strong>retrospective</strong>: gymmers are encouraged to show solutions they have found. Each solution comes with discussing and understanding pros, cons and tradeoffs. Moreover, the trainer could share new solutions and concepts, and could ask gymmers to discuss about requirements change. For instance, "what happens if the input of the problem grows by 100 times?", or "can you solve the problem without allocating extra space?" Sometimes varying the problem comes with new opportunities to simplify or complicate the solutions.

PHILOSOPHY

In software development, it's very important to give in to the right compromises. Coding Gym is an exciting way to practice identifying and understanding compromises by working on self-contained problems, naturally open to changes and variations.

Coding Gym is not tied to any paradigm nor programming language since Coding Gym exploits everything to achieve its targets. For this reason, Coding Gym is free.

Coding Gym is not a course but it is arranged by one or more trainers. A trainer does not hold nor dispense any truth, rather she is just someone who will show vulnerability of attendees and will incite them to investigate concepts and techniques to improve.

Coding Gym is not a contest. Using pair programming, Coding Gym creates an environment conducive to active learning and collaboration, helps to lower gymmers frustration with too challenging problems. Pair programming encourages gymmers to interact with peers, thereby creating a more communal and supportive environment. The collaboration inherent in pair programming exposes and reinforces gymmers to the collaboration, teamwork, and communication skills required in industry.

Since 2016, regular attendees have reported that "Coding Gym makes a pleasant environment to":
- improve problem analysis and algorithm design skills
- learn new concepts, algorithms, data structures and coding patterns
- practice known languages and experiment new languages
- improve collaboration and communication skills
- prepare for coding interviews

Coding Gym does not require advanced programming knowledge. Clearly, very often "brute force" solutions don't work (or just partially do) because Coding Gym aims towards improving people's "coding brain".

Some problems are taken from real job interviews of tech giants such as Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Twitter and Amazon.
