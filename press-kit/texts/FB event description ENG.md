# Facebook Event Description

Coding Gym is a programming lab format aiming towards continuous improvement and training of programming problems analysis and solving. Coding Gym has been created and developed by Marco Arena since 2016.

Each lab consists in solving 3 self-contained problems, spending 30 minutes on each. People work in pair using any programming language they like, coding and testing directly on the browser, thanks to HackerRank.

After each challenge, the Coding Gym moderator facilitates a retrospetive: an open discussion on all the solutions found, aiming towards understanding tradeoffs, pros and cons of each. In addition, the moderator may lead people to new solutions. 

Moreover, during this phase, the moderator could change the problem and let people discuss about the impact of such variations on the solutions previously discussed. For instance, "what happens if the input of the problem grows by 100 times?", or "can you solve the problem without allocating extra space?" Sometimes varying the problem comes with new opportunities to simplify or complicate the solutions.

In software development, it's very important to give in to the right compromises. Coding Gym gives an exciting way to practice identifying and understanding compromises, by working on self-contained problems which can be changed further.

Coding Gym's main targets:
- improve problem analysis and algorithm design skills
- learn new concepts, algorithms, data structures and coding patterns
- practice known languages
- experiment new languages
- improve collaboration and communication skills
- prepare for coding interviews

Coding Gym does not require advanced programming knowledge. Clearly, very often "brute force" solutions don't work (or just partially do) because Coding Gym aims towards improving people's "coding brain".

Some problems are taken from real job interviews of tech giants such as Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Twitter and Amazon.
